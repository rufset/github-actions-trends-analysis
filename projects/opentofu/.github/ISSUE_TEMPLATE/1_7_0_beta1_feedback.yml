        ## Provider-defined functions
        
        To test, you can use the [corefunc](https://library.tf/providers/northwood-labs/corefunc/latest) provider by [Ryan Parman](https://github.com/skyzyx):
        
        ```hcl
        terraform {
          required_providers {
            corefunc = {
              source = "northwood-labs/corefunc"
              version = "1.4.0"
            }
          }
        }
        
        provider "corefunc" {
        }
        
        output "test" {
          value = provider::corefunc::str_snake("Hello world!")
          # Prints: hello_world
        }
        ```
