We prefer to use Github issues only for reporting of actual bugs, or for requests for new features (preferably by means of a pull request).
Before submitting an issue, please check the following:
- You are using in the latest version of Revive Adserver.
- You have reviewed the information and guidelines for reporting bugs at https://www.revive-adserver.com/support/bugs/
- You have reviewed the documentation pages at http://documentation.revive-adserver.com/
- You have reviewed the FAQ page at https://www.revive-adserver.com/faq/ to ensure your case is not already answered there.
- You have searched the Community Forums at http://forum.revive-adserver.com/ for any answers to your problem or question.
- If it's not a bug, but rather a question, please post your topic at http://forum.revive-adserver.com/

If you've gone through all of the above, and are convinced you should open an issue to report a bug, then follow these guidelines:
- Properly format the issue title â€“ `Scope :: One short and clear sentence to describe the issue`.
- Provide a detailed description of the issue.
- Provide any/all relevant information: screenshot, screencast.
- Provide the steps that one must take to reproduce the issue.

Please make sure that your issue is detailed, otherwise it will not be prioritized due to lack of information.
