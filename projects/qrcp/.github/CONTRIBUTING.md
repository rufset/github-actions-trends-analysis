Contributions to this project are super welcome, so here's my recommendations:

- Make sure that the no one is already working on what you are going to fix/implement

    We use the [someone is working on this](https://github.com/claudiodangelis/qrcp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22someone+is+working+on+this%22) label to mark issues that are being taken care of by someone, so please have a look before starting coding

- If you want to take on an open issue, please announce it in the thread

    This does not mean you have to _ask_ first, but it makes sure that there won't be the case where more than one person are fixing the same bug or implementing the same feature without being aware of each other work, which usually results in a someone's time being wasted

- Discuss implementation before writing the actual code

    If you think what you are going to work on will take some time and effort, I recommend to share your thoughts in the thread first

- Review pending pull requests

    Help other users by reviewing their code

- Explain the pull requests

    Help reviewers by explaining how the patch works, what bugs/problems it addresses and _how_ it should be tested

- Address one problem per pull request

    When possible, avoid submitting a pull request that addresses more than problem

- Run `go fmt` before submitting the pull request and address `golint` issues
