<!--
- If PR is fixing any issue please add `Fixes #1234` as a first thing in the description of your PR
- Describe what is the issue being fixed
- If there is any follow-up work please create issues for that
- If your PR is adding device binding please make sure to read [conventions for devices APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/iot/blob/main/Documentation/Devices-conventions.md)
- Avoid force pushing to your PR (especially on large PRs) - it makes it much harder to incrementally review
