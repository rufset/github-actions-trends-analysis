## Report malware or abuse

Please fill out the form to report malware or abuse in an OpenUPM package to the OpenUPM admin team.

The OpenUPM admin team will review the report and act accordingly. In cases where malware or abuse is confirmed, the package will be removed and the namespace will be blocked.

Sensitive information should be sent to admin@openupm.com, included this issue link.

Please note that this report goes to the OpenUPM admin team for triage, not the package maintainer. To report bugs or vulnerabilities in a package please contact the maintainer directly.

If the package violates the [Unity Software Additional Terms](https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service/software) or [Unity Package Guiding Principles & Guidelines](https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service/software/package-guidelines), please be more specific about which term(s) it breaks. To learn more about the Unity terms, please visit the [Unity forum](https://forum.unity.com/threads/updates-to-our-terms-of-service-and-new-package-guidelines.999940/) or contact Unity at terms@unity3d.com.
