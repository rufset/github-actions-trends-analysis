NOTICE:

Windows 7 is not technically supported. This software may work on
Windows 7, but no fixes will be made for it. Microsoft ended EXTENDED support
for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020. There is a note about Windows 7 in the wiki.

Only the standard terminal app and Powershell are supported. Non-standard shell
environments (Cmder, Hyper, Cygwin, git) often manipulate file paths and other
features. While an attempt is made to make NVM4W work in as many environments
as possible, we cannot realistically test every non-standard shell.

ðŸ’¬ Failure to fill in the basic questions may result in slow/no response or
dismissal of the issue. This project has had too many empty issues with nothing
more than a title and we cannot guess about your environment. Save everyone some
time and provide answers that will help the project maintainer(s) isolate and
fix the issue.
