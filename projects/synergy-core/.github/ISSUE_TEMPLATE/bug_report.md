### Operating Systems ###

---BEGIN HELP---

Remember: Delete the help text (between `---BEGIN HELP---` and `---END HELP---`).
Technical support: https://symless.com/contact/customer-support?help-option=GitHub

For example:

Server: niceOS 10.42
Client: Awesome XP SP13

Please distinguish which operating system is the client and which is the server. The server is the computer that the mouse and keyboard are shared from.

---END HELP---

### Synergy Version ###

---BEGIN HELP---

If you're not using the latest version of Synergy, please update first:
https://symless.com/synergy/downloads

Please don't rely on Linux package manager versioning, they often get it wrong. If using the command line, you can use the `--version` arg to get your installed Synergy version, like so:

Synergy 1: `synergys --version`
Synergy 2: `synergy-core --server --version`

If you're using the Synergy 1 config app (main Synergy app) then go to the Help menu, and click About. In Synergy 2 Beta, the version is displayed at all times.

---END HELP---

### Steps to Reproduce ###

---BEGIN HELP---

This is the most important part. Try to remember exactly what exact steps caused the bug. Please make sure the steps are numbered and concise, like so:

1. Do a little dance
2. Make a little love
3. Get down tonight

Expected: Awesome things to happen
Actual: Not so awesome things happened

Before submitting, try to reproduce the bug based on the steps you provided.

---END HELP---

### Log URLs ###

# README & DELETE #

---BEGIN HELP---

Please do not paste entire logs here, it looks really silly. Instead, upload your logs, and share the URLs to the uploaded logs. Here's how you that:

Synergy 1: https://symless.com/help/s1-troubleshooting/s1-sending-logs
Synergy 2: https://symless.com/help/s2-troubleshooting/s2-sending-logs

Make sure you say which log is for which computer, and also which computer is the client and which one is the server. This helps to avoid any confusion.

---END HELP---
