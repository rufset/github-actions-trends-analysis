Ensure you comply the following requirements:

- [ ] I have read [Contribute section](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/scripts/scripts/vaccinations#5-contribute).
- [ ] I am proposing changes for a single country CSV file in [output](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/scripts/scripts/vaccinations/output).
- [ ] If adding data to a country with an [_automated process_](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/scripts/output/vaccinations/automation_state.csv), I have waited at least 48 hours since data was reported.
- [ ] I have collected the data from an official source.
