## Submitting issues

- Please search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already reported or even fixed.
  - Go to "Issues" and type any word in the top search/command bar.
  - Consider to search on closed issues. To do that just remove "is:open" from the search field.
  - More info on [search syntax within github](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues).
- Report the issue using our [template](https://github.com/saenzramiro/rambox/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), it includes all the information we need to track down the issue.

Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.
