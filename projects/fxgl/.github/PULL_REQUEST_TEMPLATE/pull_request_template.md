### Pull Request (PR) prerequisites

- Please do not create a PR without creating (or discussing if exists) an issue first. Any change needs to be discussed and confirmed before proceeding.
- Please do not refactor code in the same PR as the one that addresses an issue. Create a separate PR with refactored code: typos, cleanup, imports, etc.
- Put `#XXXX` in your comment to link (or close) the issue that your PR fixes.
- Please make sure you have read the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Failure to meet the above is likely to result in the rejection of the pull request.**
