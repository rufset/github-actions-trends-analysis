            :wave: @{issue-author}, sorry you're having an issue. As the issue template explains, we require that you provide a runnable example that reproduces your issue (please read the [issue template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Custom.md)).

            The reason is that maintainers do not have time to try reproduce bugs themselves. Please try to minimize the superfluous code and focus only on reproducing the bug.

            Please create a new issue with this and we'll be happy to review it! If you're hitting a hard wall, you may consider [paid assistance](https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin/pull/861).
