**Checklist**

- [ ] The issue is not answered by reading the [FAQ](https://github.com/opengapps/opengapps/wiki/FAQ)
- [ ] The issue is part of The Open GApps Project scope *(and not of the pre-built OpenGApps.org packages scope, for support on those see [XDA Forum](http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/Open-GApps-t3098071))*

*If Open GApps compilation fails:*
