      Steps to reproduce the behavior.

      We ‚ù§ code! Point us to a minimalistic repro project hosted in a public GitHub repo.
      For a repro project, create a new project with ASP.NET API Versioning using the template of your choice and apply the minimum required code to result in the issue you're observing.

      We will close this issue if:
      - the repro project you share with us is complex. We can't investigate custom projects, so don't point us to any, please.
      - we will not be able to repro the behavior you're reporting.
      - the GitHub repro project is set to `Private`.
