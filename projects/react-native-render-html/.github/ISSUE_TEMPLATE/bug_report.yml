If you can't check those two boxes, this is a feature request, not a bug. Fill a feature request here: https://native-html.canny.io/features

    description: |
      [*What is a Minimal, Reproducible Example (MRE)?*](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Provide either a link to an expo snack, git repository, or a code block. You can fork [**our Snack template**](https://snack.expo.dev/@jsamr/rnrhtml-template) to gain time (follow instructions from the README in this snack)! The MRE **must be self-contained**, and **HTML inlined** unless strictly necessary (e.g., a bug with remote HTML). Also note:
      - If your issue is related to operations such as dependency resolution or testing, **you must** provide a MRE in the form of a git repository. 
      - If and only if you provide a regression test in lieu of a MRE, you can reference the related PR instead.
