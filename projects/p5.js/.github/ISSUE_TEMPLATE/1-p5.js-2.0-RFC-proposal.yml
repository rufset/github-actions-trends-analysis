        ### Acceptance criteria
        The [p5.js 2.0 RFC](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/dev-2.0/rfc_p5js_2.md) is a compilation of proposals for the next major version of p5.js. 
        
        **‚úñÔ∏è New features**: In order to focus the community's efforts, proposals for new features will typically not be accepted into the RFC. A [New Feature Request](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Feature+Request&projects=&template=feature-request.yml) may still be submitted, but it will only be considered after the release of p5.js 2.0. 
        
        **‚úîÔ∏èExisting features**: This proposal will be accepted if the community determines it would improve an existing feature through a breaking change, a systemic change, or an overdue change.
