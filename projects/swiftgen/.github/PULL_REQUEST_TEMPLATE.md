* [ ] I've started my branch from the `develop` branch (gitflow)
  * [ ] And I've selected `develop` as the "base" branch for this Pull Request I'm about to create
* [ ] I've added an entry in the `CHANGELOG.md` file to explain my changes and credit myself  
      _(or added `#trivial` to the PR title if I think it doesn't warrant a mention in the CHANGELOG)_
  * [ ] Add the entry in the appropriate section (Bug Fix / New Feature / Breaking Change / Internal Change)
  * [ ] Add a period and 2 spaces at the end of your short entry description
  * [ ] Add links to your GitHub profile to credit yourself and to the related PR and issue after your description
