          **Did you know? Most problems can be resolved by running 3 commands:**
          
          - `composer self-update`
          - `composer global update`
          - `brew upgrade`

          ... in fact, it's good to run these commands at least once a month!
          
          Alternatively, try to reboot your machine first to see if it solves your current issue.
