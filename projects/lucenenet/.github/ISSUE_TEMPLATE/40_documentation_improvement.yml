      Please keep in mind that the GitHub issue tracker is not intended as a general support forum, but for reporting **non-security** bugs, feature requests, and for general tasks to work on. Since Lucene.NET is mostly a line-by-line port from a **specific version** of Lucene, feature requests should generally be limited to improvements that make Lucene.NET interoperate with .NET better.
