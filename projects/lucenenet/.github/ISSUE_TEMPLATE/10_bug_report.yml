      Please keep in mind that the GitHub issue tracker is not intended as a general support forum, but for reporting **non-security** bugs, feature requests, and for general tasks to work on. Since Lucene.NET is mostly a line-by-line port from a **specific version** of Lucene, feature requests should generally be limited to improvements that make Lucene.NET interoperate with .NET better. Bugs that have already been reported and/or fixed in Lucene should generally not be reported again here, as the patch will be carried over to Lucene.NET during the upgrade.

      If you believe you have an issue that affects the SECURITY of the platform, please do NOT create an issue and instead follow the [ASF vulnerability reporting process](https://apache.org/security/#reporting-a-vulnerability). This is a project of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org) and follows the ASF [vulnerability handling process](https://apache.org/security/#vulnerability-handling).
      
      For other types of questions, consider using [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and applying the tags `lucene.net` AND `lucene` or join the [Lucene.NET user mailing list](https://lucenenet.apache.org/contributing/index.html#ask-a-question).

      - The repro project does not contain an index or a way to create one. You must provide some basic test data.
