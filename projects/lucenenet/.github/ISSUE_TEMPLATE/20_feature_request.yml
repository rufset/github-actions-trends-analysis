      Please keep in mind that the GitHub issue tracker is not intended as a general support forum, but for reporting **non-security** bugs, feature requests, and for general tasks to work on. Since Lucene.NET is mostly a line-by-line port from a **specific version** of Lucene, feature requests should generally be limited to improvements that make Lucene.NET interoperate with .NET better.
      
      We should keep Lucene.NET version-aligned with Lucene for future porting efforts to go smoothly. Please **do not request features from newer versions of Lucene**. We will upgrade the entire project to get these features all at once when the API is stable. We have very little hope of maintaining the project if we don't have a version of Lucene to run to compare code execution with, so version compatibility takes precedence over features from newer versions.
