        Thanks for taking the time to open an RFC!
        Please note that this is for detailed proposals.
        If you have a feature request, or would like to brainstorm,
        the [forums](https://community.redwoodjs.com/) is a better place to start.

  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Summary
      description: >
        Start with a summary to frame the proposal.
        If the proposal involves a new API or a change to an existing one,
        including a code example upfront goes a long way.

      description: >
        Here your goal is to answer the question "Why are we doing this?"
        As put by other RFC templates,
        "enumerate the constraints you're trying to solve
        without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind."

        Write your proposal here. You're welcome to structure it however you like, but the more detail, the better. Get into the specifics and include examples. Keep this non-exhaustive list of questions in mind as you write:

        - What's this about? (The CLI? The web side? The api side? Both?)
        - What's the design in detail?
        - Is this a breaking change? How easy will it be for existing Redwood apps to adopt? Can we write a codemod for it?
        - What parts of the design are still TBD?

        Lastly, consider reading some great examples:

        - [Prerender proposal](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/prerender-proposal/849)
        - [Optional path parameters](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues/2429)
        - [Multitenant support](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues/5821)

        Nice work! 👏 Now that you're all done,
        take a moment to reread your issue's title.
        Is it descriptive enough?
        Does it still ring true? 🤔
        If not, take a moment to rewrite it.
