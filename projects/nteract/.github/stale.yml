  This issue hasn't had any activity on it in the last 90 days. Unfortunately we don't
  get around to dealing with every issue that is opened. Instead of leaving issues
  open we're seeking to be transparent by closing issues that aren't being prioritized.
  If no other activity happens on this issue in one week, it will be closed.

  It's more than likely that just by me posting about this, the maintainers will take a
  closer look at these long forgotten issues to help evaluate what to do next.

  If you would like to see this issue get prioritized over others, there are multiple
  avenues 🗓:

    * Ask how you can help with this issue 👩🏿‍💻👨🏻‍💻
    * Help solve other issues the team is currently working on 👨🏾‍💻👩🏼‍💻
    * [Donate to nteract](https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/donate-to-nteract/index.html) so we can support developers to work on these features and bugs more regularly 💰🕐

  Thank you!
