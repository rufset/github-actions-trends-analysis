    - Major: if server changes are required (eg. provision with ofn-install)
    - Minor: larger change that is irreversible (eg. migration deleting data)
    - Patch: all others. Shortcut: `script/release/tag`
- [ ] [Draft new release]. Look at previous [releases] for inspiration.
    - Select new release tag
    - _Generate release notes_ and check to ensure all items are arranged in the right category.
