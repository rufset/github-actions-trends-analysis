##### Issue submission checklist

 - [ ] This is not a generic OpenCV usage question (looking for help for coding, other usage questions, homework etc.)
   <!--

   Use Q&A forums such as https://answers.opencv.org/questions/ and https://stackoverflow.com/ and other communities
   to discuss problems. Tickets without real issue statements related to this build toolchain will be closed.

   -->
 - [ ] I have read the README of this repository and understand that this repository provides only an automated build toolchain for OpenCV Python packages (there is no actual OpenCV code here)
   <!--

   If you have some OpenCV bug report which needs to fixed in the C++ code, 
   please report issue to the OpenCV repository:
