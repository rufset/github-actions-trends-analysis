Common responses to issues.

## Ignored issue template, bug report

Due to limited volunteers, all issues are required to use our [issue template](https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md). Please open a new issue and follow the instructions. We can help, but we require you to take an active leadership role in fixing any issues you identify. If code changes are needed, you can open an issue for discussion, but you must commit to authoring a PR.

## Usage Question

Due to limited volunteers, we can't accept usage questions. Please ask such questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/authlogic). We don't even have enough volunteers to accept non-security bug reports, unless you can commit to fixing them yourself, and just need some help. If you can commit to fixing a non-security bug yourself, you can open an issue, but please follow our issue template.

## Usage question we were able to answer

```
If that doesn't answer your question, please ask a new question
on [stackoverflow][1]. Unfortunatley, we just don't have enough volunteers to
handle usage questions on github.

Also, please check the [reference documentation][2]. You might find something
there that's not in the readme.

Thanks!

## Old issue, generic

```
Hello, I'm going through old authlogic issues and seeing what to do with them.
Skimming through this, it's unclear if it's a usage question, a feature
suggestion, or a bug report.

If this is a bug report, and you can still reproduce this issue with a clean
install of the latest version of authlogic and rails (currently 3.6.0 and 5.1.4
respectively), please create a git repo with a sample app that reproduces the
problem, and open a new issue.

If this is a feature suggestion, it's still relevant, and you are committed to
implementing it, please open a new issue and we can discuss your implementation
plan.

If this is a usage question, please ask it on [stackoverflow][1]. Unfortunatley,
we just don't have enough volunteers to handle usage questions on github. Also,
please check the [reference documentation][2]. You might find something there
that's not in the readme.

Thanks!

## Old issue, usage question / feature suggestion

Hello, I'm going through old authlogic issues and seeing what to do with them.
This one looks a bit like a usage question and a bit like a feature suggestion.

If this is a feature suggestion, it's still relevant, and you are committed to
implementing it, please open a new issue and we can discuss your implementation
plan.

If this is a usage question, please ask it on [stackoverflow][1]. Unfortunately,
we just don't have enough volunteers to handle usage questions on github. Also,
please check the [reference documentation][2]. You might find something there
