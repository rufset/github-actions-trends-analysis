# Note: if running a release build, this command is required:
#   echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
# See the mention of `inotify` in docs/.  If we attempt assembleRelease,
# then without this line the JS bundle step fails with a baffling ENOSPC
# error, even though there's tons of free space on the filesystem.
