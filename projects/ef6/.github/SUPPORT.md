Security Issues
---------------

If you believe you have an issue that affects the security of the platform, please email your issue to secure@microsoft.com. You may even be eligible for our [bug bounty](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/mt764065.aspx) by doing this.

Bugs & Feature Requests

EF6 is no longer being actively developed. We do not intend to implement any new features or fix most bugs other than security issues. See the repo [README](https://github.com/dotnet/ef6/blob/main/README.md) for more information.

Documentation

See [the EF6 docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/ef6/) for installation, documentation, tutorials, samples, etc. This documentation is no longer being updated, but still contains useful and usable content.
