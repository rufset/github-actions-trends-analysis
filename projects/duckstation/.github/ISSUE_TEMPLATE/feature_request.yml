      **Please read before creating a new feature request:**
      1. Make sure there is not already an issue for this feature request by [searching in **both** open and closed issues](https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+).
      2. Please open **one issue per requested feature**. Do not cram several unrelated feature requests in a single issue, as this makes it harder for contributors to track what's being worked on.
      3. Please post your feature request in English, as this is the only language spoken by the developers. The [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Buktv3t) has many helpful people if you need help translating.
      4. Issues about the libretro core will be deleted (you will be blocked from the repository if you create such an issue). That core is not DuckStation, it is a broken fork, and has nothing to do with us.
