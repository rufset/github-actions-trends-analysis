# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to the system's nature as a Software-as-a-Service (instead of installable libraries), only the latest released version will be considered for security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You may submit vulnerability reports to teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg.

We will strive to respond in 24 hours, and in the event of an accepted report, no more than 72 hours before providing an estimate resolution time.
