<!--
IMPORTANT PLEASE READ: Hi there! If this is a *usage question* or you're not sure if its a bug, please **do not post it here**, create a discussion first https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/discussions. If this is not a “feature” or a “bug”, or the phrase “How do I...?” applies, then it's probably a usage question. Thank you!

Most usage questions are not actually redux-observable specific, but rather general RxJS questions and patterns, so you can also find help in the RxJS community at large. RxJS bugs can be reported in their repo: https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs

If you would like to chat you can join the Reactiflux discord https://discord.gg/reactiflux look for the channels #redux or #reactive-programming.

**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**

**What is the current behavior?**


**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and a minimal demo of the problem using JSBin, StackBlitz, or similar.**

<!--
The easier it is to reproduce the more likely someone will be able to quickly help. Very often in the process you may discover it's not a bug or gain a better understanding of what the cause is.

Here are some you can use as starting points:

**What is the expected behavior?**


**Which versions of redux-observable, and which browser and OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of redux-observable?**
