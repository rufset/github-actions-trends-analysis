        _Keep in mind that development is focused on improving performance and fixing graphical bugs, rather than
        implementing new features (such as resource pack features, additional graphical settings, etc.) We believe that these
        kinds of features or enhancements are out-of-scope for Sodium, and should be left to other standalone mods._
