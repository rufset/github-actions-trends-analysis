# Vision

Gitignore.io's vision is to become the authoritative source for `.gitignore` templates.  Gitignore provides templates for Operating Systems, IDEs and Programming Languages, but can eventually grow to encompass other creative spaces as well.

## Ways You Can Help

1. **Add Templates** - Add templates for Programming Languages, Operating Systems and IDEs at [@toptal/gitignore](https://github.com/toptal/gitignore)
2. **Explore** - Create better ways for users to interact with gitignore.io.
