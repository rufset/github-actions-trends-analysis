💚💜 Thank you for interest. ❤️💛
Please make sure to check for more efficient package management. *Please prioritize checking existing issues first. I will repay with higher-quality code.*

**To Reproduce**
- [ ] I have read [README.md](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API). Please read me.
- [ ] I have searched for existing issues. *(Most of the issues are duplicates.)*
- [ ] I installed the appropriate version and confirmed that the previous version was properly removed upon reinstallation. 
- [ ] I also checked the environment (not only on a single local machine but also on Google Colab, different Google accounts, and tried resetting cookies, etc. Please make sure to attempt these steps if necessary, and test the functionality in a new virtual environment if needed.)

Example
```
pip uninstall bardapi # and restart kernel
pip install bardapi==0.1.29 # check proper version
pip install -u bardapi==0.1.29 # upgrade version
```

```python
import bardapi
bardapi.__version__
```
