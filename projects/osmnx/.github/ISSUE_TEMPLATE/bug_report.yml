      label: Complete minimal reproducible example
      description: |
        This example code snippet must be *minimal* so it doesn't contain extraneous code or data unrelated to your specific problem and it must be *complete* so we can independently run it from top to bottom by copying/pasting it into a Python interpreter. That means all imports and all variables must be defined. If you're unsure how to create a good reproducible example, read [this guide](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports). Do not post a screenshot of your code or error message: provide it as text. Auto-rendered as code, no need for backticks.
