- [ ] I have ran the application to make sure my code runs
- [ ] I have used the correct [ISO 639-1 code](https://www.alchemysoftware.com/livedocs/ezscript/Topics/Catalyst/Language.htm) for my translations (e.g. `en`)
- [ ] I have made sure to leave a `,` at the end of each translation added
- [ ] I have added the language to `supportedLanguages` in alphabetical order
- [ ] I have added the language to the table in README.md in alphabetical order
- [ ] (_If you translated the README_) I have translated the README and linked it in the main README.md
