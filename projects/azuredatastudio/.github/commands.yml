If you could attach your logs to the issue (ensure no private data is in them), it would help us fix the issue much faster.\n\nTo find your logs:\n\n- Open command palette (Click **View** -> **Command Palette**)\n- Run the command: **`Developer: Open Logs Folder`**\n\nThis will open the log file locally. Please include renderer.log",
