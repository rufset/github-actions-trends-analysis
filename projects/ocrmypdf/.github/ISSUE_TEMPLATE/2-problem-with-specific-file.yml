        If you cannot provide a test file, we probably won't be able to help with the issue.
        PDF is a complex file format, and there may be technical details in the PDF that are
        causing the issue. There's really no substitute for a test file.

        We understand files may contain personal or sensitive information. Here are some options:
        - Try reproducing the issue with a file from the test suite. (See tests/resources)
        - Try to create another file in the same way as your private file.
        - Encrypt the file to OCRmyPDF's private GPG key, and then zip the GPG file.
        - Use ``qpdf --json yourfile.pdf`` to produce a JSON representation of your file that
          omits personal information.
