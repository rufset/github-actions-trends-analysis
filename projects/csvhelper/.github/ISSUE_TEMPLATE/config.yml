    about: All questions should be directed to StackOverflow.
           Please only submit a question if no one has been able to answer your question on StackOverflow. 
           I have very limited time to work on this project, and would prefer to use that time for bugs and features.
           Thanks.

    about: If StackOverflow has failed you, you can ask a question on the disucssions board.
           Please add a link to your StackOverflow question so we can answer it in both places.
