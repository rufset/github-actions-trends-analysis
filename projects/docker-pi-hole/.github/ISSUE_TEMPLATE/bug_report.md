## These common fixes didn't work for my issue
<!-- IMPORTANT! Help me help you! Ordered with most common fixes first. -->
- [ ] I have tried removing/destroying my container, and re-creating a new container
- [ ] I have tried fresh volume data by backing up and moving/removing the old volume data
- [ ] I have tried running the stock `docker run` example(s) in the readme (removing any customizations I added)
- [ ] I have tried a newer or older version of Docker Pi-hole (depending what version the issue started in for me)
- [ ] I have tried running without my volume data mounts to eliminate volumes as the cause

If the above debugging / fixes revealed any new information note it here.
Add any other debugging steps you've taken or theories on root cause that may help.
