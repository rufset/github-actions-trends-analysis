Before you file a bug...

* Is this a question?
  Ask it on our discussion area: https://github.com/xunit/xunit/discussions
* Is this a bug with VSTest (aka Visual Studio Test Explorer, `dotnet test`, `dotnet vstest`,
  or `vstest.console.exe`)? Open those issues here:
  https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/
* Did you search the docs @ https://xunit.net/ ?
* Did you search the issues list to see if someone already reported it?
  When looking for duplicates, make sure to look through open **and** closed issues.
* Did you create a simple repro for the problem?
  Bugs without repro projects will be automatically closed.
