Before you submit a PR...

* Did you ensure this is an accepted ['help wanted' issue](
  https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issuesq=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)?
* Did you read the project governance @ https://xunit.net/governance ?
* Does the code follow existing coding styles? (tabs, comments, no regions, etc.)
* Did you write unit tests?
