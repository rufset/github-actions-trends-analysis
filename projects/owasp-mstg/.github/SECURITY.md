# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the OWASP MASTG project seriously. If you find any security vulnerability in the repo, e.g. in our `src` folder or in our GitHub Actions configurations, we appreciate your effort in responsibly disclosing it to us.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

Please report any security vulnerability by opening an issue in our GitHub repository. Provide as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including:

- Detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce or proof of concept.
- Any potential impacts.
- Suggestions for remediation. If possible, please open a pull request including the fix.

If you have any questions please reach out to the project leaders:
