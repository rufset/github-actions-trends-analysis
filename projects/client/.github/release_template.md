### Template
[Release Template](https://github.com/owncloud/client/blob/master/.github/release_template.md)

__TODO__:
* Check if anything is missing from [release_template_outdated_2020.md](https://github.com/owncloud/client/blob/master/.github/release_template_outdated_2020.md) and merge here. We use the same template for a patch, minor or major release now.
