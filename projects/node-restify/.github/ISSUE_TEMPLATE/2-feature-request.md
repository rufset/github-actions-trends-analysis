<!-- Thank you for taking the time to open an issue for restify! If this is
your first time here, welcome to our community! We are a group of developers
who work on restify in our free-time. Some of us do it as a hobby, others are
using restify at work. When asking for help here, keep in mind most of us are
volunteers contributing our daily work back to the community at no cost (and
often for no reward). Please be respectful!

Below you will find two templates, one for filing a bug report, and the other
for requesting a feature. Remove the comments from around the template that is
applicable to your case and fill it out accordingly. This standardization helps
the maintainers gather the information they need up front to verify and respond
to problems accordingly, ensuring you get the fastest response possible! -->
