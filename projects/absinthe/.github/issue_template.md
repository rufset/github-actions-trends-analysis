### Precheck

We're a small team and Absinthe is a big project, so please keep the
following in mind when submitting an issue:

- For help and support, use:
  - Our Slack channel (#absinthe-graphql): https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com
  - The Elixir Forum: https://elixirforum.com
  - The documentation, to include guides: https://hexdocs.pm/absinthe
- For new features, consider discussing the idea with us via Slack/Forum before submitting an issue
- For bugs, do a quick search and make sure the bug has not yet been reported
- Please try to ensure that your issue is related to the core Absinthe package and not one of the
  related packages. (We may ask you to move it, otherwise.)
  - If it's Plug-related, you probably want `absinthe_plug`
  - If it's Phoenix-related or about websockets, you probably want `absinthe_phoenix`
- All checked? Be nice and have fun!
