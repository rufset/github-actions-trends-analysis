## Code contributions

While we have not gotten around to setting up a code style for eclipse yet as we are mostly IntelliJ IDEA users, for the most part we use Google's java formatting style, modified to four spaces, wider column widths, and less force wrapping. For IntelliJ users you can find the style [here](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/blob/1.19.x/docs/Mekanism.xml), and information on how to import a code style into IntelliJ can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-code-style.html).
