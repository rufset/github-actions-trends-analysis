        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
        Please only report pyzmq-specific bugs on this repo,
        i.e. missing options, pyzmq build failures,
        event loop problems.
        General problems or questions about zeromq sockets
        (e.g. missing messages, etc.)
        are best directed towards [zeromq/libzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq) instead.

      label: This is a pyzmq bug
      description: Make sure to open issues about zmq socket behavior (e.g. HWM, LINGER, missed or dropped messages) on zeromq/libzmq itself, not here.
      options:
        - label: This is a pyzmq-specific bug, not an issue of zmq socket behavior. Don't worry if you're not sure! We'll figure it out together.
