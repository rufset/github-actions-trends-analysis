# This check runs only on PRs that are in the merge queue.
#
# PRs in the merge queue have already been approved but the reviewers check
# is still required so this workflow allows the required check to succeed,
# otherwise PRs in the merge queue would be blocked indefinitely.
#
# See "Handling skipped but required checks" for more info:

# Note both workflows must have the same name.
