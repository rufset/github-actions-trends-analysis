This software has been used for many years by many users. Especially if you're new to ACME, 
the chance that your validation problems are caused by some misconfiguration instead of a bug 
in the program are pretty high. Therefor we ask that you first please check the 
FAQ/guide at https://www.win-acme.com/manual/validation-problems.

If - and only if - you still believe that your validation issue is caused by a bug you can open 
an issue here, supported by the appropriate evidence (e.g. logs, screenshots). 

Otherwise please first ask for help at https://github.com/win-acme/win-acme/discussions or 
the appropriate support channel at your ACME service provider.
