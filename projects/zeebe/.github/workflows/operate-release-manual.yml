# This GitHub Actions (GHA) workflow is used to manually trigger a release for `operate` application.
#
# It takes several inputs:
# - 'branch': the branch from which to build the release.
# - 'releaseVersion': the version number to apply to the release (in pom.xml and the Git tag).
# - 'nextDevelopmentVersion': the version to use after the release.
# - 'dryRun': if true, the release is built but no changes are made or artifacts (Docker, Maven) are pushed. Defaults to `true`.
# - 'githubUploadRelease': if true, the release will be uploaded to GitHub. Defaults to `false`.
# - 'isLatest': if true, the Docker image will be tagged with the 'latest' tag. Defaults to `false`.
#
# The workflow leverages a reusable workflow (./.github/workflows/operate-release-reusable.yml)
# to perform the actual release process.
#
# It allows you to manually dispatch the workflow with custom input parameters to control the release process.
# This can be done through GitHub's UI by navigating to the "Actions" tab of the `operate` repository, then clicking on the
# "Run workflow" dropdown, selecting the workflow, filling in the input fields and clicking "Run workflow".
