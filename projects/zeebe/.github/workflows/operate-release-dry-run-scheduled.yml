# This GitHub Actions (GHA) workflow performs a scheduled dry-run of the release process for `main`.
#
# The workflow is scheduled to run at 03:00 from Monday through Friday, according to the cron format.
#
# For each run, it iterates over a matrix of branches and their associated release versions.
#
# Each iteration invokes the reusable release workflow (./.github/workflows/operate-release-reusable.yml)
# in dry-run mode (no changes or artifacts are pushed).
#
# This dry-run scheduled workflow is designed to provide an assurance check that the release process will execute as expected when performed live.
